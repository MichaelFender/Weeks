    <h2>Famous FROGS</h2>
    <h4>Some frogs are famous!  We love them!!</h4>
    <p>
        A frog is any member of a diverse and largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, tailless amphibians composing the order Anura;literally without tail in Ancient Greek. The oldest fossil "proto-frog" appeared in the early Triassic of Madagascar, but molecular clock dating suggests their origins may extend further back to the Permian, 265 million years ago. <br>Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic regions, but the greatest concentration of species diversity is in tropical rainforest.
    </p>
    <p>
        Warty frog species tend to be called toads, but the distinction between frogs and toads is informal, not from taxonomy or evolutionary history.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are about 7,300 recorded species, which account for around 88% of extant amphibian species.[1] They are also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders.

        <h4>Like ... a lot!  We just think they are dandy!</h4>
        <p>
            A dragon is a large, serpentine, legendary creature that appears in the folklore of many cultures worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beliefs about dragons vary considerably through regions, but dragons in western cultures since the High Middle Ages have often been depicted as winged, horned, four-legged, and capable of breathing fire.
